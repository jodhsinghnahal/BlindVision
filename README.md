# BlindVision

BlindVision is a web application that helps blind and visually impaired people to see and describe the world around them.

The app uses a combination of computer vision and artificial intelligence to identify objects and obstacles in the user's environment. BlindVision can then use this information to provide the user with a description of their surroundings.

## Features

* Object recognition: BlindVision can identify a wide range of objects, including people, animals, furniture, and food.
* Obstacle detection: BlindVision can detect obstacles in the user's path, such as stairs, curbs, and potholes.
* Navigation assistance: BlindVision can provide turn-by-turn directions to help the user navigate to their destination.
* Speech output: BlindVision can speak aloud the names of objects and obstacles, as well as provide turn-by-turn directions.

## How it works

BlindVision uses a combination of computer vision and artificial intelligence to identify objects and obstacles in the user's environment. The app's computer vision algorithms process images from the user's smartphone camera to identify objects and obstacles. The app's artificial intelligence algorithms then use this information to provide the user with turn-by-turn directions and other assistance.
